## setup
Several functions are implemented in CUDA using CuPy, which is why CuPy is a required dependency. It can be installed using `pip install cupy` or alternatively using one of the provided [binary packages](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#installing-cupy) as outlined in the CuPy repository. Please also make sure to have the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable configured.

In order to generate the video results, please also make sure to have `pip install moviepy` installed.

## usage
To run it on an image and generate the 3D Ken Burns effect fully automatically, use the following command.

```
python autozoom.py --in ./images/doublestrike.jpg --out ./autozoom.mp4
```

To start the interface that allows you to manually adjust the camera path, use the following command. You can then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` and load an image using the button on the bottom right corner. Please be patient when loading an image and saving the result, there is a bit of background processing going on.

```
python interface.py
```

To run the depth estimation to obtain the raw depth estimate, use the following command. Please note that this script does not perform the depth adjustment, see [#22](https://github.com/sniklaus/3d-ken-burns/issues/22) for information on how to add it.

```
python depthestim.py --in ./images/doublestrike.jpg --out ./depthestim.npy
```

To benchmark the depth estimation, run `python benchmark-ibims.py` or `python benchmark-nyu.py`. You can use it to easily verify that the provided implementation runs as expected.
